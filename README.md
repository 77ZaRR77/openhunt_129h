OpenHunt 1.29h mod for Quake 3 Arena
=================
Originally made by Jurgen "Juhox" Hoffmann.
This repo has working stable preinstalled OpenHunt 
currently with 1.29h q3 gamecode
based on Eugene C. improved fast q3tools 
and his mod folder structure for comfort use.
Plus 3 cosmetic patches included, fov fix, lens flare in ffa bugfix and redblood instead of brown.

#### Instuctions:
Compile: build/win32-qvm/compile.bat
If you want just to play grab the hunt folder and put same location with your q3 exe and from mods play it. It's already with compiled openhunt vm.

#### [TODO](TODO.md)
