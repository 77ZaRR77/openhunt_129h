// To find out what music files are available in Hunt, start it,
// open the console, and enter "/dir music" (without the
// quotes). To add your favourite music .wav files, ZIP them,
// rename the .zip file to .pk3, and put it in the Quake3/baseq3
// directory. Note that the "addtrack" command requires the
// exact path you've used in the .zip file. That is, if you just
// ZIPped the plain files you'll probably need to state something
// like "addtrack my_music_file.wav" (without any path).
//
// If Hunt can't find your music files, check the directory
// structure of your .zip file. Do not use absolute paths. If the
// paths are ok, try a lower compression level. Q3 does not
// support some compression methods.
//
// You'll get a warning message if your .wav files are not in
// 22kHz 16bit stereo format. You can safely ignore this. But
// note that the Q3 sound engine is currently (version 1.31) not
// able to play 8bit music. You'll hear unpleasant junk instead,
// seems to be a bug. It's not my fault.
//
// MP3 files are currently not supported. Ask id software for MP3
// support...
