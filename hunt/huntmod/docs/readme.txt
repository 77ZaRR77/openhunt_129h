Requirements:
   Quake III Arena 1.32

Installation:
   1. Create a directory named "Hunt" in your Quake3 directory (which is
      the directory that contains the "baseq3" directory).

   2. Just copy the files mentioned above into the new directory. Take
      care to preserve the paths, e.g. "ctf_juhox_pliers.tss" should end
      up as "Quake3/Hunt/tss/ctf_juhox_pliers.tss."

   3. If there's a "hunt1.pk3" file in your Hunt installation directory,
      make sure to delete it.

   To run the Hunt mod start Quake3 and choose "Hunt" from the "Mods"
   menu. You can immediately play a match. Thereafter, don't forget to
   check at least the "manual.txt" to learn more about Hunt.
